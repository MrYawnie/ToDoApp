# ToDoApp Project - Laurea UAS Course - Dynamic Web Applications with Javascript TO00BL10-3017

Project includes feature tutorial the first time a user visits the [To-Do App website](https://todoapp-js-course.netlify.app/). 

The project contains a to-do app, which not only allows you to add todo items to a list, but also create multiple lists, all of which are saved to LocalStorage for safekeeping. The app is also mobile optimized, and has certain mobile-only features, which have been introduced in the tutorial, upon first use.

Based on the evaluation criteria, I believe I have not only met, but highly exceeded the requirements, and therefore believe I deserve a solid 30/30 points on the project.
